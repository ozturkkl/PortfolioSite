        <h2>My Life</h2>
        <p>I was born in Turkey. As a kid, I was always interested in technology and music. I love listening to music whenever I can. My passion for computers and technology grew in time as more and more advanced devices filled the market. I always wanted to be a part of the awesome development of these gadgets or software. I have an interest in gaming too, I love 3D and Visual Effects. My goal is to become a creator in one of these fields. I had good opportunities to improve myself. I went to a military high school where I got to solve a lot of problems, gain leadership skills and build my character. I also started university back in my home country as a software engineer. Later on, I decided to continue my education in the US so here I am. </p>
